# exploring-source-code
a journey to explore source code of popular frameworks, inspired from `numbbbbb/read-vue-source-code`

## Why
* I would love to understand how things work under the hood
* A centralized place to take notes for importance understanding for future usages (interview questions, recap,...)
* Improve my own writing skill
* Improve my explanation skill

## No-scope
* ~awesome repository
* Tutorial
* Tips and tricks
* 

## How to Read This Series
* Go through content session for the major topics, each will then have it own `content`
* 

## Who This Series is For
* My future self :)

## Contents
* [ ] Read source code of ASP.Net core, compare how it work with (event loops, sharing `libuv`...)
